# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values

# Client configuration
# By default the app should proxy Gemini requests through a server so the API
# key is kept secret. To enable the client to POST prompts to the server proxy,
# set the flag below to true and run a server that provides /api/generate-gear.
#
# For local development (client):
VITE_USE_PROXY=true

# Do NOT put your production Gemini API key here. If you only want to run the
# SDK client-side (NOT recommended), set VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY locally for testing.
# VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
